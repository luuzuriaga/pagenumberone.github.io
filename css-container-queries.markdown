css Container Queries
---------------------
## You definitely squished em didn't you?

Using the all new CSS container query to make the lil' squishies angry.

JS used for button functionality. All other logic used CSS-only.

HTML Template tags used to easily duplicate.

### TODO:
- Squishy animations would really make this pop. (on enter, on delete, on hover, blinking effects in between states, smoothly morph from one face to the other etc)
- Responsiveness: Percentage widths aren't currently possible with container queries which makes having consistent behaviour between mobile and desktop tricky
